    "SolarTravel has been delivering earth-weary travelers to the Solar System’s most luxurious destinations since we began operating the world’s first recreational intra-solar system transport craft in 2175.",

    "Since then, we’ve expanded our fleet to include newer, faster, and more luxurious transport vessels that include increased legroom, simulated gravity, and the latest in holo-synapse entertainment technologies.",

    "SolarTravel’s longstanding mission is to deliver each of our ludicrously wealthy customers to their selected destinations while providing a relaxed, and (hopefully) oxygen-rich atmosphere along the way.",

    "Please note that all potential travelers must sign SolarTravel’s explosive decompression indemnity waiver prior to their launch date."
